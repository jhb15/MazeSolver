Maze Solver
===========
###### by James H Britton (jhbritton96@icloud.com)

 This is my solution for the Gentrack Maze Solver Technical test, to solve this problem I used a 
 recursive backtrack algorithm. There are probably better solutions using other algoritms but this was
 the simplest and quickest to implement and does this job. I also wrote a C# console application to
 utilise this recursive application.
  
#### How to run the app
> ###### Windows (Built for Windows 10)
>
>> Step 1: Start application using the MazeSolver2.exe
> 
>> Step 2: Once you see the menu listing the options press the 'S' key on you keyboard
>
>> Step 3: When you are asked for a file path enter the path to the input file you wish to use and peress enter
>
>> Step 4: You should now see the maze outputted followed by the solution to the maze
