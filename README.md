Maze Solver
===========
###### by James H Britton

 This is my solution for the Gentrack Maze Solver Technical test, to solve this problem I used a 
 recursive backtrack algorithm. There are probably better solutions using other algoritms but this was
 the simplest and quickest to implement and does this job. I also wrote a C# console application to
 utilise this recursive application.
